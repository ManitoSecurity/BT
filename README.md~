  bt_phone
___________________________________________________________________________

  * prototype communication arduino to phone with rn41
  * indicates "detection" when IR sensor picks up movement

  TO DO
  ------------
  * better reciept of commands from phone
  * improve alerts to wait after sending and avoid false positives

  Known Problems
  ---------------
  * command from phone often recieved while the arduino is checking connection or somthing,
    so it gets lost

  Versions
  ---------------
  **bt_phone_v2**
    working prototype communication arduino to phone with rn41
    indicates "detection" when IR sensor picks up movement
    master can send 'A' or 'D' to arm or disarm the device
    also checks connection with phone
    functions to send BT commands and recieve response


  **bt_phone_v1**
    initial prototype
    indicates "detection" when IR sensor picks up movement
    also checks connection with phone
    functions to send BT commands and recieve response

**trials and tribulations**
  precursors to bt_phone_v1
  ugly mess

**bt_start**
  example communication between two rn41 chips
  found online- gross code that doesn't work
  may still provide workflow for future iterations
