BT
=========

Arduino sketches to prototype communication over BT with rn-41
data sheet here: https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Wireless/Bluetooth/rn-bluetooth-um.pdf


** bt_phone_v1 **
  prototype communication arduino to phone with rn41
  indicates "detection" when IR sensor picks up movement
  also checks connection with phone
  functions to send BT commands and recieve response
  not debugged- may not work

  TO DO
  add arming and disarming capability

** trials and tribulations **
  precursors to bt_phone_v1
  ugly mess

** bt_start **
  example communication between two rn41 chips
  found online- gross code that doesn't work
  may still provide workflow for future iterations
